Project to get all the pf2 data into a json file, 

Spells is done currently, Monsters is done, verified as much of the data I can
Currently working on backgrounds, classes are next.

If you feel you need to get updated data be careful running these as they do a good number of requests over a short peroid onto the respective sites

if you have a request for data let me know
