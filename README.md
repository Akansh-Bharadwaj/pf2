If you feel you need to get updated data be careful running these as they do a good number of requests over a short peroid onto the respective sites

if you have a request for data let me know

To pull all new data run python runAllFiles.py  While running it will build a file of pf2Update-YYYYMMDD.txt . If the process fails it uses this to pick back up without rewrunning everything.
